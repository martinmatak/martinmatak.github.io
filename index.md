I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) working with [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans). 

In December 2024 I got my PhD, also from the University of Utah.
I was advised by Tucker Hermans, and the focus of my PhD was on multifingered grasping and manipulation of everyday objects. During my PhD, I spent two years interning at NVIDIA tackling the same problem. 

Previously, I earned my M.Sc. degree in [Logic and Computation](https://logic-cs.at/master/) from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) where I was advised by [Georg Weissenbacher](http://www.georg.weissenbacher.name/), and a B.Sc. degree in [Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/study_programs/undergraduate_study/computing) from University of Zagreb.

I am a PhD student in the [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). I am part of [Utah Learning Lab for Manipulation Autonomy](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/home) and am advised by [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans). I am interested in robot learning, a field at the intersection of machine learning and robotics.

Previously, I earned my M.Sc. degree in [Logic and Computation](https://logic-cs.at/master/) from [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/) where I was advised by [Georg Weissenbacher](http://www.georg.weissenbacher.name/), and a B.Sc. degree in [Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/study_programs/undergraduate_study/computing) from University of Zagreb.
